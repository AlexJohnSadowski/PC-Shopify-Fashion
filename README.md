## R. - Fashion Shop Project

E-commerce platform made with React and Storefront API from Shopify. I use context API for the state management.

I didn't really spend much time on the styling of the application, so I decided to quickly bootstrap it with a really nice CSS-in-JS library named Atomize. The idea was to play around with shopify and get a better understanding of its backend.


YEAH, IM DOING THAT FOR YOU D-----e!
