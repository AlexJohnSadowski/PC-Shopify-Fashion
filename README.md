# UNDER DEVELOPMENT
## Patrice Cadet. - Fashion Shop Project

E-commerce platform made with React and Storefront API from Shopify. I use context API for the state management.
Minimalistic. As the main theme I used Yves Klein's international blue.

Demo: https://patricecadet.netlify.app/


I didn't really spend much time on the styling of the application, so I decided to quickly bootstrap it with a really nice CSS-in-JS library named Atomize. The idea was to play around with shopify and get a better understanding of its backend.

Update #1 - not a huge fan of atomize, so decided to slowly rewrite the existing atomize css on sass.
Now I only need to add GSAP for some snazy animations;)


YEAH, IM DOING THAT FOR YOU D-----e!
