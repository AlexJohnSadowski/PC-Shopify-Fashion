## Patrice Cadet. - Fashion Shop Project

E-commerce platform made with React and Storefront API from Shopify. I use context API for the state management.
Minimalistic. As the main theme I used Yves Klein's blue.




Demo: https://patricecadet.netlify.app/

You can add products, edit them etc. through your shopify account. Payments via cards are also possible, but currently they are only in the test mode. All is fetched. Shopify is cool. Love it.

I didn't really spend much time on the styling of the application, so I decided to quickly bootstrap it with a really nice CSS-in-JS library named Atomize. The idea was to play around with shopify and get a better understanding of its backend.

Update #1 - not a huge fan of atomize, so decided to slowly rewrite the existing atomize css on sass.
Now I only need to add GSAP for some snazy animations;)

YEAH, IM DOING THAT FOR YOU D-----e!
